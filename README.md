## üîç What Is a 4CH PoE Switch?

A **4CH PoE Switch** is a compact Ethernet switch with 4 PoE-enabled RJ45 ports that can transmit both data and electrical power over the same Cat5e/Cat6 cable. Most models also include one or two uplink ports (non-PoE) to connect to a router, NVR, or uplink switch.

These switches follow IEEE 802.3af (PoE) and/or 802.3at (PoE+) standards, and are plug-and-play, requiring no configuration.
